Add a books I've read section. I could add something for what I learned from each book.

Like a map of all the countries I've been to where they get colored in. Idk I could do one for
like each contintent

Get a cool quote generator
Hell spanish word of the day could be fun too

On the main page have like a timeline, they can click on events in the timeline and get more detail

Book review kinda page. Like it can list books and I can give a rating

Add a footer with links to other things


Ok, to get time in zone data, My minimum unit for time in zone will be a week. So I could see time in zones for each week. This way I can caluclate each further split using the weeks.
So if I want time in zone for May, just add up the weeks there. This way I can do one massive calculation, but then once that is done quickly have access to better chunks of data.


Also, thgere is cool anmalysis I can do. Like I can correlate time of day with watts or something to see. Also curious like where the hardest rides are. That could be good for analyzing 
how I periodize. Ideally you would see the hardest rides all split up 3 weeks apart over ther ytear. You can see how the overload is oging as well.
