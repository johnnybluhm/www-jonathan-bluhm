This is a very good definition of artificial intelligence. Consider how we created Deep Blue, a super computer who beat the world champion in chess. At the time it was considered a breakthrough in AI, yet now no one considers our chess engines AI. Alan Turing was a pioneer when it came to AI research. He believed that by the year 2000 we would already have AI. It would seem Turing was wrong about his prediction, but perhaps he was not. There is something very similar about a human brain and a computer. This is why most say that AI is inevitable, but our technology has not advanced enough yet. There are various problems associated with developing AI. The way to test if one has intelligence is the major issue. Ultimately, AI will never be developed because we as a species like to consider ourselves superior to every being. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain and computers are closely related. They are so related that philosophers developed a theory of the mind that the states that the mind is a very advanced computer. </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Machine Functionalism is a specific type of functionalism stating that the mind is a Turing machine. A Turing machine is a device that takes in inputs, and produces a specific output. This is exactly what a computer is. Machine functionalists argue that the brain is a very complex Turing machine, and that the psychology of any organism can be represented by a Turing machine. Given a list of all possible inputs and outputs to an organism, and knowing which input causes which output, a theory can be crafted that will perfectly predict what an organism will do (Kim, 2011).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before crafting the theory, an issue involving internal states must be addressed. Behaviorism eventually failed because it could not deal with internal mental states. For instance, being hit by a baseball causes winces and groans, yet it can also cause the desire to want to stop playing baseball. So an input can cause multiple other mental events to occur which will eventually trigger the final output. In the case of the Turing machine psychology, we consider each input and other inner workings to be one input. The only concern is what the output will be. This is rather concerning however, since different Turing machines can take the same input, produce the same output, yet be completely different internally. While this is true, it is not a death sentence for Machine Functionalism. The theory could still make very accurate predictions about what organisms will do. It may not lead to the complete truth of what mental states are, but could be very useful for various applications (Kim, 2011). Despite these concerns, since the psychology of any organism can be represented as a Turing machine, machine functionalists state that &ldquo;having&rdquo; a Turing machine is psychology, or mentality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;In short, our brain is our mind because it is a computing machine&hellip;&rdquo;(Kim, 2011, p. 151).</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span>While machine functionalism seems to have some merit, when thought about in depth it becomes clear that</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>machine functionalism</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">does not work. Due to properties of Turing machines, an internal state of a Turing machine can only refer to itself. This is because a Turing machine has a machine table that has internal states which will affect the other internal states of the machine. The consequence of this is that for any organism to share the same mental state with another organism, the psychology of both must be the same. So in order for two humans to both feel pain, they must have the exact same brain. This does not make any sense at all. Humans are drastically different from one another when it comes to personalities, yet almost all humans feel pain. In addition to this, suppose a computer was developed that had the exact same input output system of a human. According to Machine Functionalism, the computer and the human have the exact same psychology. This seems rather ridiculous, the human is certainly aware of what he is doing while the computer is just grinding through code. Due to this, Machine Functionalism is similar to Behaviorism in that it cannot distinguish real mentality from simulated mentality. </span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4">Our brains are clearly distinct from computers, yet this still does not rule out a computer being created that is similar to the brain. How can we test this computer for mentality? We would have to watch the computer and see if it acts intelligently. Let us consider one of Searle&rsquo;s thought experiments to see if this would work. It goes as follows: consider you are blind, and go to the doctor for treatment. The doctor offers you silicon eyes to replace your blind ones. You accept the offer and can now see. What a wonderful thing! Since you have a propensity to hit your head, you continue to injure your brain and get it replaced with more silicon parts. Eventually your entire brain is made of silicon and you live a long and prosperous life. This is the ideal case. Yet suppose our story goes a darker route, and with each silicon part put into your brain, a part of &nbsp;&ldquo;you&rdquo; is lost. Your motor functions all stay the same, but you are slowly losing control. The doctor pinches you and asks if you feel pain, and you want to say &ldquo;help, I&rsquo;m stuck in here&rdquo;, but your bodily representation says &ldquo;it hurt just a little.&rdquo; Suppose that instead of your mind being lost, the silicon parts cause your bodily functions to go away. You are still completely conscious, yet are completely paralyzed. The doctor declares that you are brain dead as you respond to no stimuli, and you are lying there screaming &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still here!&rdquo; What we learn from this experiment is that behaviour is not sufficient to show mentality (Searle, 1998).</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4">This concept can be illustrated further with another thought experiment. Suppose we have robots working on a line. They are adequate, yet make mistakes more than we like. We develop technology to make them conscious which we think will help them work better. This makes sense, if they are aware of their mistakes they are less likely to make them. So we insert consciousness into them and our problem is solved. The machines are working far better than previously. Unfortunately though, we find out that our conscious robots are completely miserable. In order to help the robots, we seek alternative ways to make our robots. Eventually, we discover how to keep the robots at the same effectiveness, but without the consciousness component. So we have a set of robots that are conscious and a set of robots that are unconscious with the exact same behaviour. We have again arrived at the same conclusion. Behaviour is completely irrelevant regarding something&rsquo;s consciousness. There would be no way to tell by watching the robots which are conscious and which are not (Searle, 1998).</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span>While consciousness cannot be tested for by behaviour, the question is begged if it even matters. Let us consider Block&rsquo;s thought experiment. A billion people in china are all hooked into a network. Everyone can communicate with each other instantly via satellite communication. Each person responds to various inputs and produces various outputs. Essentially each person is acting as a neuron in our brains. This China brain is then used to control some massive being (Chin, 2018). Is the being controlled by the China brain conscious? The goal of the thought experiment is for everyone&rsquo;s intuitions to say &ldquo;obviously this thing is not conscious.&rdquo; This means that we think consciousness requires more than just functional input output systems. Yet, I do not think this intuition should be trusted. Our own brains do not seem like systems that should have qualia. Not all intuitions are correct. It seems intuitive that the sun revolves around the earth, yet we now know that this is clearly false. </span><span class="c2">&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t understand how human consciousness is produced, then it makes little sense to attempt to make a robot phenomenally conscious&rdquo; (Chin, 2018, p. 8). So since solving consciousness is impossible right now, why even worry about it?</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c7">Alan Turing had a different view on intelligence that has nothing to do with consciousness. Turing viewed intelligence as an emotional concept. Turing argues that we find something intelligent based on our own training and mind states. If we can figure out a pattern in something, we will likely not call it intelligent. Consequently, two people could have differing views on something&rsquo;s intelligence based upon their own intelligence. Consider playing chess. Often times players will pretend to make mistakes, but in reality are setting up a grand master plan. A weaker player would view the opponent as dumb for such moves, while a better player would identify the trap and view his opponent as smart. What all this boils down to is that intelligence is arbitrary. If most people believe that the world is flat, they will think people that think the world is round are dumb. Turing asked in his 1950 paper if machines can think. He was not a big fan of this question: &ldquo;</span><span class="c4">The original question, &lsquo;Can machines think?&rsquo; I believe to be too meaningless to deserve discussion.&rdquo; (Turing, 1950, p. 441) What Turing was really asking was if machines can be intelligent. By his definition of intelligence, we can again change the question to: can machines be perceived as intelligent?</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span>Turing proposed a test to answer this question, the imitation game. The game is played with three people: a man, a woman, and an interrogator. The interrogator can be of either sex and is in a room separated from the man and the woman. The object of the game is for the interrogator to ask questions to the man and woman, and determine which one is the man and which one is the woman (Turing, 1950). The interrogator asks questions through text so that the voices do not give away information. Turing proposed we put a computer in this game and see if it can do well. Can a human tell that they are talking to a computer within five minutes, 70% of the time? This is the Technological Criterion for AI. </span><span class="c7">&ldquo;The Technological Criterion requires that a system&rsquo;s structure (or program) enables it to imitate the human brain very well, to the extent that a human interrogator experiences it as intelligent.&rdquo; (Danziger, 2018, p.165) </span><span class="c4">Turing believed that if we can create machines that achieve the Technological Criterion, then eventually society will view the machines as intelligent. His test works great for this. We humans generally base other human&rsquo;s intelligence based on how they talk. This is why Turing chose speech as the behaviour to be tested instead of mathematical prowess. </span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4">Turing was not without his critics when he proposed these ideas. The Theological objection argued that thinking comes about because humans have an immortal soul. No animal or machine can have an immortal soul, so only humans can think. The Heads in the Sand objection states that the ramifications of machines being able to think would be very devastating, so we should hope that they cannot. Both of these arguments are tremendously weak, and Turing dismissed them just as quickly as I have. The Mathematical Objection attacks the fact that computers cannot have infinite memory, so given enough time they will eventually lose at the imitation game. Turing&rsquo;s response is that the argument relies on the assumption that humans do not have any limitations on their own intellect. We as humans are wrong all the time, yet we think. So why can&rsquo;t a thinking machine be wrong sometimes? The argument from consciousness states that until a machine can write a poem from emotion and feelings, and know that it wrote a poem, it&rsquo;s thinking cannot be equal to our thinking. This argument just denies the validity of Turing&rsquo;s proposed test. It wants to bring consciousness back into the discussion, but we know that consciousness is irrelevant. &ldquo;According to the most extreme form of this view the only way by which one could be sure that machine thinks is to be the machine and to feel oneself thinking...Likewise according to this view the only way to know that a man thinks is to be that particular man&rdquo; (Turing, 1950, p. 444).</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span>While Turing&rsquo;s test works great for fulfilling the Technological criterion, it cannot help with the </span><span class="c7">Sociolinguistic Criterion.</span><span>&nbsp;This is &ldquo;...t</span><span class="c2">he requirement that the system be such that its kind is perceived by society as potentially intelligent&rdquo; (Danziger, 2018, p. 168). Turing realized that humans have a bias towards machines. We humans love to feel superior, so we naturally assume we are the only intelligent creatures. Consider how people naturally assume animals are not conscious. It is not hard for humans to think of other humans as intelligent, but as soon as a machine or animal is brought up, the idea that the machine or animal might be intelligent is considered ludicrous. While we may view a machine as intelligent for a time, it will eventually lose it&rsquo;s flair. Consider the first smartphones. Look at the name: smart phone. We have viewed machines as intelligent before. Yet today, nobody refers to their phone as a smartphone. They are just phones now. As smartphones became more accessible and standard to have, we stopped viewing them as smart. This is the fundamental nature of humans. We are unimpressed with the ordinary.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2">In order for an AI to be developed, it will need to fulfill both the Technological Criterion and the Sociolinguistic Criterion. The Technological Criterion is likely achievable, and we have a way to test for it. Due to humanity&rsquo;s innate pretentiousness, I do not think that the Sociolinguistic Criterion can ever be fulfilled. Turing thought that by the year 2000, the Sociolinguistic Criterion would have been fulfilled, but this is clearly not the case. While some refer to their computer as smart, this is only when they first start using it. Eventually they use the computer enough and encounter a bug and their mind is changed. I find myself calling my computer stupid far more often than smart. Yet, the computer can do far more things than I can. It is better at math than me, better at chess, better at spelling. The computer can go all over the world via the internet and see places I never have. It also lives more efficiently. It does not need food or water, just airflow to keep itself cool. It does not need rest, and it can theoretically live forever. I think Turing drastically underestimated the pretentiousness of humans. Even with our current technology, the fact that we do not view our machines as smart seems absurd.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2">Furthermore, the way humans view intelligence makes satisfying the Sociolinguistic Criterion unrealizable. &ldquo;Tesler&rsquo;s Theorem expresses this point elegantly (Larry Tesler, ca. 1970): &lsquo;Intelligence is whatever machines haven&rsquo;t done yet.&rsquo;&rdquo;(Danziger, 2018, p.170). No matter how advanced our technology gets, people will cease to be impressed by it given time. This can be seen with electricity. I&rsquo;m sure when it was first invented people were amazed that they could stay up and read when it was dark out. Being able to flip a switch instead of lighting a fire for light must&rsquo;ve felt amazing. Does anyone even care about electricity these days? The only time we notice it exists is when it goes away. Yet electricity is an extremely complex thing, and the fact that we can harness it should amaze us. This normalizing of technology will always happen. It happened right before our eyes with smartphones. It happened with the internet. I remember being blown away by being able to type in a question on askjeeves.com (now ask.com) and get an answer. Now I just get mad when google makes me scroll through results for more than ten seconds.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c7">Tesler&rsquo;s theorem can also be seen in our pursuit of AI. It was once thought that chess would be a great test to s</span><span class="c7">ee if compu</span><span class="c7">ters can act intelligently. Chess is considered a very hard game to play. The thought was that if a computer could beat the best human, then we would have made an AI. By pouring resources into this pursuit, the goal was accomplished. The chess computer</span><span class="c12 c7">,</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;Deep Blue</span><span class="c7 c12">, </span><span class="c7">was created and it beat the world champ Kasparov (Danziger, 2018). Yet, no one today talks about AI already being created. What instead happened, is that being good at chess is no longer considered intelligent. When we could not make a machine that was good at chess, playing chess was considered smart. As soon as we made a machine that was better at it than humans though, the flair behind it was lost. This same thing will happen with everything we do. It has already happened with arithmetic. Being good at arithmetic was once considered a valuable skill, and people good at it were considered smart. Nowadays it is considered a meaningless skill. We have calculators to do it all for us, why bother getting good at arithmetic? The same thing happened with maps. </span><span class="c7">My father is a &ldquo;map guy&rdquo;. He knows the highways around the country and the best routes to get from state to state. Do I perceive him in high regard because of this skill? I certainly do not</span><span class="c2">. I always just ignore his advice and tell him what google maps said. If machines are better at x thing than humans, then x thing is not considered intelligent.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2">While fulfilling the Sociolinguistic Criterion seems impossible, perhaps there is a machine that we could develop that would satisfy it. Suppose we developed robots that can talk just as well as humans do. They talk like us, move like us, but look like metallic robots. They also have distinct robot voices. Would robots like these be perceived as intelligent? Again, I think not. We would just view them as really good conversation simulators. Suppose however, that we developed a test for consciousness and that these robots passed the test. Society now views the robots as intelligent. Humans love feeling superior and would be angry that we created robots equal to us. Mass discrimination against the robots would ensue, and we would resent them. They would be a symbol that humanity truly is not that special, and that consciousness can be replicated. Our humanity could no longer be defined by our minds. We would have to develop some other reasons as to why we are special. Perhaps we would view ourselves as gods because we created consciousness. Humans would also try and act distinctly from the robots. Maybe we would develop telepathic communication so we no longer have to audibly speak like the robots. </span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c7">From this we can gather that there is only one way to truly create an AI that fulfills the Technological and Sociolinguistic criteria: we create an AI that kills all of us. Even if the test for consciousness were to be developed, people would question the validity of the test. The robots would be considered intelligent for a time, but eventually people would get used to them and consider them dumb machines again. The robots would have to do something truly drastic to show us that we deserve their respect. Well what do humans respect? Humans respect what they fear. Consider a dog chained up. Kids will tease the dog and have a good time with it because the dog can&rsquo;t do anything to them. However, if the dog is free to run around then the kids will leave the dog alone because they are afraid. We humans hold ourselves in such high regard that we fear almost nothing. Hence we will never respect any robot no matter how sentient it becomes. If the machines begin killing us however, our view on machines will fundamentally change. We will now hold the robots in higher regard and the </span><span class="c2">Sociolinguistic Criterion will finally be met. If we do get to this point though, I&rsquo;m afraid all of the humans will be dead so no one will be there to marvel at our creation.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c7">To summarize, minds and brains are similar, yet creating an AI is an impossible task. Machine Functionalism shows how our brains are distinct from computers. Various thought experiments showed how testing for consciousness is not a realistic goal, and another approach is necessary. Alan Turing developed a test involving playing the imitation game with a computer. While this test is sufficient to satisfy the Technological Criterion for AI, it cannot help with the Sociolinguistic criterion. Due to human nature, it appears that realizing the Sociolinguistic criterion can only be accomplished one way: by all of humanity being killed by an AI. Hopefully we can evolve as a species and start giving machines the credit they deserve, else the future of our race looks rather bleak. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><h1 class="c11 c6" id="h.5rxarq1tyd22"><span class="c4"></span></h1><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c11 c6" id="h.d0h39i3oocb3"><span class="c4"></span></h1><h1 class="c11" id="h.ie0ju6idepex"><span class="c4">References</span></h1><p class="c10"><span class="c2">Chin C.
